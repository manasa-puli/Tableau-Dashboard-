# 🌍 Economic Indicators & Population Well-being

This project analyzes how various economic indicators influence the health and well-being of populations across countries from 2011 to 2020. 

## 📊 Key Highlights:
- Explores unemployment trends and their connection to poverty and social stability.
- Shows correlation between fertility rate and GDP per capita using scatter plots.
- Compares wage/salaried vs. vulnerable employment and its impact on life outcomes.
- Uses interactive visualizations (bar, line, scatter, lollipop charts) for data insights.

## ✅ Conclusions:
- Countries with higher GDP per capita and job security tend to have better health outcomes and lower fertility rates.
- Nations facing unemployment and vulnerable employment experience poorer living standards and social challenges.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements:
- Add more recent data (2021–present) for extended analysis.
- Integrate healthcare and education indices for deeper insights.
- Implement interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
